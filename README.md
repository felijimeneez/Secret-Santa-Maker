# Secret-Santa-Maker
If you want to play Secret Santa use this! 

Make a virtual enviroment and install tkinter 3.9.

Run Secret Santa with python3 secret_santa_ui.py

This program has been made in one day (my mother couldnt find a free program to organize a Secret Santa game so she asked me for it). Its simple and it works. 
You should send each text file to each participant respectively (its on you if you read it before sending it!)
UI is not the best but works!
